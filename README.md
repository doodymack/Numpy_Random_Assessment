# Numpy_Random_Assessment

An investigation into the Numpy package for assessment as part of  Programming for Data Analysis Assessment.

Author: Paul Mc Grath

Tools use: Numpy/Jupyter lab/

Objective:

Using a Jupyter lab notebook to explain the use of the NumPy package including details of at least 5 5 of the distributions provided f or in the NumPy package.  The following are covered:

1. Explain the overall purpose of the package.
2. Explain the use of the “Simple random data” and “Permutations” functions.
3. Explain the use and purpose of at least five “Distributions” functions.
4. Explain the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers

How to use Numpy_Random_Assessment Notebook:

1. The notebook should be opened as an executable notebook
2. The notebook contains a mixture of Markdown explanation text followed by executable python code text
3. Should not all cells execute, the kernel shouul be re-run (run all) from the start- optional to clear all outputs
4. Most python code cells contain additional explanatory comments to assist understanding the code
5. Some markdown cells conmtain hyperlinks to additional background information from the web
6. References used are included in the notebook. Additional copy only
7. The first sections of the notebook contain a high level summary of the Numpy package including arrays
8. In the event that the reader is already familiar with these topics, these sections can be skipped
