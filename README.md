# Numpy_Random_Assessment

An investigation into the Numpy package for assessment as part of  Programming for Data Analysis Assessment.

Author: Paul Mc Grath

Tools use: Numpy/Jupyter lab/

Objective:

Using a Jupyter lab notebook to explain the use of the NumPy package including details of at least 5 5 of the distributions provided f or in the NumPy package.  The following are covered:

1. Explain the overall purpose of the package.
2. Explain the use of the “Simple random data” and “Permutations” functions.
3. Explain the use and purpose of at least five “Distributions” functions.
4. Explain the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers

What is NumPy:

NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more.
